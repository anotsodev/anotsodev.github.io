Hello! I'm Kyle, SANS GCFA and GREM certified, and I appreciate you taking the time to visit my site.

In this blog, I share my experiences and insights on tackling vulnerable machines from Hack the Box and Vulnhub. You'll find detailed write-ups and solutions, as well as guides on configuring various technologies commonly used in organizations.

By day, I work as an Incident Responsder, and by night, I enjoy the challenge of pwning vulnerable machines from HTB and Vulnhub.

In my free time, I also do casual gaming and explore random stuff. Now, feel free to explore my site and hopefully you would find it insightful!
